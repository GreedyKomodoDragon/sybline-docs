<h4>Welcome to the Sybline Documentation!</h4>

Sybline is an open-source simplicity-first focused Message Broker, we aim to create a solution that can be deployed without too much knowledge of message brokers. Sybline has High Avalibility built into each of its features.

Our features:
- **High Avalibility**
- **Snapshotting**
- **Direct Routing**
- **Batch Processing**

## Alpha Development

Sybline is very much in the Alpha Development stage, while we aim to avoid any API changes, we cannot 100% ensure that breaking changes will be introduced while Sybline is being developed.

## Getting Started

Head to our <a href="/en/page-2">Cluster Setup</a> pages to get started using Sybline in your projects. 

Currently we support only the following client languages:
* Go

We plan to offically support:
* Java
* JavaScript/TypeScript
* Python
* Rust

There is currently no road map for these to be supported in v0.1.0.
## Want to Get involved?

We're more than happy for commmunity support in this project! Currently we have no offical channels of communication, these will be coming soon!

Head over to our <a href="https://gitlab.com/Sybline">Gitlab organisation</a> and have a look!
