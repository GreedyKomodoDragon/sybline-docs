<h4>Welcome to the Sybline Documentation!</h4>

Sybline is an open-source simplicity-first focused Message Broker, we aim to create a solution that can be deployed without too much knowledge of message brokers. Sybline has High Avalibility built into each of its features.

Our features:
- **High Avalibility**
- **Snapshotting**
- **Direct Routing**
- **Batch Processing**

## Alpha Development

Sybline is very much in the Alpha Development stage, while we aim to avoid any API changes, we cannot 100% ensure that breaking changes will be introduced while Sybline is being developed.

## Getting Started

Head to our <a href="/en/page-2">Cluster Setup</a> pages to get started using Sybline in your projects. 

Currently we support only the following client languages:
* Go

We plan to offically support:
* Java
* JavaScript/TypeScript
* Python
* Rust
