In the following section we will provide a series of way how a Sybline Cluster can be deployed, and any recommendation we have found. 

The provided examples cover:
* Docker Compose
* Kubernetes via Helm Chart

For production, we recommend using Kubernetes if possible since will be the only deployment option that will be recieving more updates and patches. We do not plan to offically support Docker Compose as a solution for production.
